I was tired of using the Notes app to log my weights for different exercises I use in my gym workouts. This app stores all my exercises and categorizes them by muscle group. Users can create an account and store their workouts here too.

A convenient way to move your workout routine out of the notes app and into the Rise and Grind app! No ads, ever.

This app utilizes Google Cloud Firestore API to securely store data. An email is only required for signing up. No confidential information is required for use (not even your name!).

HOW TO USE:

Create an account with an email and password. Add a workout category (i.e. back, chest, legs, abs) then add an exercise. Use the "+" icon in the top right corner to get started adding workouts.
