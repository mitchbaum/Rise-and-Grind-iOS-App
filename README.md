# Rise and Grind iOS App

# Purpose

I was tired of using the iOS Notes app to log my weights for different exercises I use in my gym workouts. This app stores all my exercises and categorizes them by muscle group. Users can create an account and store their workouts here too. This app offers a convenient way to move your workout routine out of the notes app and into the Rise and Grind app!

Created using Swift, UIKit, Google Cloud - Firebase

# Features
- Login or create an account to store your workouts and access them on any iOS device
- Categorize exercises by muscle group 
- Last modified label
- Easily see sets, weights, and reps from home page for each exercise
- Customize the order of exercises within the workout
- Display weights used in LBS or KG
- Archive of exercises with data archived so you can keep track of progress
- Recover password functionality
